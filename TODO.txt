List of things TO DO currently:

- Upload all my TFM codes to GitHub.
- Explore the simulation configurations proposed in my table.
- Check if the solution obtained by Paul Cally satisfies the numerical solutions.
- Introduce more complex drivers into simulations.
- Read chapter 4 of "Principles of Magnetohydrodynamics".
- Read the papers suggested by David.
- Find bibliography for the introduction of the publication.
- Plot the drift velocity.
- Extent the chromosphere to the transition region.
- Find the publication of Rankine-Hugoniot relations.
- Plot T/R vs collisional frequency (see R. Soler et al. 2013a).
- Measure the 'collisional heating term'.
- Use an explicit scheme for collisional terms instead of a the implicit one to compare with single fluid numeric results (This way, we will have the same scheme for both simulations). (Homogeneous atmosphere).
- Read Peter's papers.
- Improve the plot of the collisional terms to highlight the important terms and avoid overlapping.
- Plot Fig. 1 from Bea's publication.
- Make a periodogram for TE and FH terms.
- Deduce the period associated with the spacial lenghtscale for a snapshot and compare it with the collisional frequncy.
- Make ambipolar coefficient evolve in time.
- Evaluate the average mass mu to estimate the importance of the correction.
