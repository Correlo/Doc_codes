List of things TO DO currently:

- Upload all my TFM codes to GitHub.
- Explore the simulation configurations proposed in my table.
- Check if the solution obtained by Paul Cally satisfies the numerical solutions.
- Introduce more complex drivers into simulations.
- Read chapter 4 of "Principles of Magnetohydrodynamics".
- Read the papers suggested by David.
- Find bibliography for the introduction of the publication.
- Use only linear terms and increase the amplitude.
- Plot the drift velocity.
- Extent the chromosphere to the transition region.
- Find the publication of Rankine-Hugoniot relations.
- Plot T/R vs collisional frequency (see R. Soler et al. 2013a)
- Define a coefficient for the smoothing factor as function of the tau parameter.
- Measure the 'collisional heating term'.
- Install mancha3D-2F in the PC of my office.
- Use an explicit scheme for collisional terms instead of a the implicit one to compare with single fluid numeric results (This way, we will have the same scheme for both simulations). (Homogeneous atmosphere).
- Update TvsZ.py to allow to introducing a list of ranges.
- Read Peter's papers.
- Prepare a code to generate animations for tomorrow.
- Improve the plot of the collisional terms to highlight the important terms and avoid overlapping.
